# Appointment Management Platform – Project Docs

Public documentation repository for my **Proyecto Integrado** (Final Project) of the *Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web (DAW)* cycle.

This repo will store:

- The official deliveries for the module (E0, E1, E2, E3).
- Diagrams and early design sketches.
- Notes, decisions and planning related to the project.

> 📄 **Spanish version**: see [`README.es.md`](README.es.md)

## Project overview

The project is a **web platform for appointment and service management** aimed at freelance professionals and small businesses.

The goal is to provide:

- An online booking system for clients.
- A simple control panel for professionals (availability, services, calendar).
- Integrated online payment for sessions (test mode during the TFG).

The **source code** of the application will live in a **private repository** to protect the project’s intellectual property.  
This public repo is only for documentation and planning.
